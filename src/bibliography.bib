This article describes basic good computing practices and offers advice for writing clear code that facilitates the task of replicating the research. The goals are simple. First, the researcher should be able to replicate his or her own work six hours later, six months later, and even six years later.},

Long presents lessons gained from his experience and demonstrates how to design and implement efficient workflows for both one-person projects and team projects. After introducing workflows and explaining how a better workflow can make it easier to work with data, Long describes planning, organizing, and documenting your work. He then introduces how to write and debug Stata do-files and how to use local and global macros. After a discussion of conventions that greatly simplify data analysis the author covers cleaning, analyzing, and protecting data."--Jacket.},

WaveLab makes available, in one package, all the code to reproduce all the figures in our published wavelet articles. The interested reader can inspect the source code to see exactly what algorithms were used, how parameters were set in producing our figures, and can then modify the source to produce variations on our results.  WaveLab has been developed, in part, because of exhortations by Jon Claerbout of Stanford that computational scientists should engage in "really reproducible" research.  1 WaveLab -- Reproducible Research via the Internet  A remarkable aspect of "the wavelet community" is the wide span of intellectual activities that it makes contact with.
